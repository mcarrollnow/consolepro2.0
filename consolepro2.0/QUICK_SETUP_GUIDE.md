# Quick Setup Guide - Fix the Google Apps Script Error

## üö® The Error You're Seeing:
```
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getSheetByName')

This happens because the script needs to run from within a Google Sheet context.

## ‚úÖ How to Fix It:

### **Step 1: Open Your Google Sheet**

2. Make sure you have a sheet called "Customers" with your customer data

### **Step 2: Open Script Editor from the Sheet**
1. In your Google Sheet, go to **Extensions** ‚Üí **Apps Script**
2. This opens the script editor **connected to your sheet**

### **Step 3: Copy the Script**
1. Delete any existing code in the script editor
2. Copy the entire `wix-customer-sync.gs` file
3. Paste it into the script editor
4. Click **Save** (Ctrl+S)

### **Step 4: Test the Connection**
1. In the script editor, select the `testWixConnection` function
2. Click the **Run** button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
3. You should see: "‚úÖ Wix API connection successful!"

### **Step 5: Set Up the Sync Sheet**
1. Select the `setupWixSyncSheet` function
2. Click **Run**
3. This will create a new sheet called "Wix_Customer_Sync"

### **Step 6: Copy Your Customers**

2. Click **Run**
