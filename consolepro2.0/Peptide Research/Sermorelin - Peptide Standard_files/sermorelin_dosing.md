# SERMORELIN Dosing Schedule & Clinical Guidelines

## Overview
Sermorelin is a synthetic 29-amino acid peptide that represents the first 29 amino acids of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). It stimulates the natural production and release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland and is FDA-approved for treating growth hormone deficiency in children. It's also used off-label for anti-aging and performance enhancement in adults.

## FDA-Approved Pediatric Dosing

### Growth Hormone Deficiency in Children
**Standard Clinical Protocol:**
- **Dose:** 30 mcg/kg body weight
- **Frequency:** Once daily at bedtime
- **Route:** Subcutaneous injection
- **Duration:** Until growth plates close or growth velocity normalizes

**Example Dosing by Weight:**
- **20 kg child:** 600 mcg (0.6 mg) daily
- **30 kg child:** 900 mcg (0.9 mg) daily
- **40 kg child:** 1200 mcg (1.2 mg) daily

## Off-Label Adult Dosing

### Anti-Aging and Wellness
**Standard Adult Protocol:**
- **Dose Range:** 200-500 mcg daily
- **Typical Dose:** 300 mcg daily
- **Timing:** Before bedtime on empty stomach
- **Route:** Subcutaneous injection
- **Duration:** Ongoing as needed

### Conservative Starting Protocol
**Week 1-2:** 200 mcg daily
**Week 3-4:** 250 mcg daily  
**Week 5+:** 300-500 mcg daily (based on response)

### Intensive Protocol
**Higher Dose Range:** 0.2-1.0 mg daily
**Frequency:** 5 days per week (Monday-Friday)
**Rest Days:** Weekend break
**Duration:** Ongoing cycles

## Administration Guidelines

### Optimal Timing
**Best Administration Time:**
- **Evening Dosing:** 30 minutes to 2 hours before bedtime
- **Empty Stomach:** 2-3 hours after last meal
- **Rationale:** Aligns with natural GH release during sleep

### Injection Technique
**Preparation:**
1. Reconstitute with bacteriostatic water
2. Typical concentration: 5mg in 2ml = 2.5mg/ml
3. Store reconstituted solution refrigerated

**Injection Process:**
- **Route:** Subcutaneous injection
- **Sites:** Abdomen, thigh, or upper arm
- **Rotation:** Different injection sites each administration
- **Needle:** Insulin syringe (29-31 gauge)

### Reconstitution Calculations
For 5mg vial with 2ml bacteriostatic water:
- **Concentration:** 2.5mg/ml (2500 mcg/ml)
- **300 mcg dose:** 0.12ml (12 units on insulin syringe)
- **500 mcg dose:** 0.2ml (20 units on insulin syringe)

## Cycling Protocols

### Standard Cycling
**5 Days On, 2 Days Off:**
- **Monday-Friday:** Daily injections
- **Saturday-Sunday:** Rest days
- **Rationale:** Prevents receptor desensitization

### Extended Cycling
**6 Weeks On, 2 Weeks Off:**
- **Treatment Phase:** 6 weeks daily administration
- **Rest Phase:** 2 weeks without treatment
- **Repeat:** Multiple cycles as needed

### Continuous Therapy
**Daily Administration:**
- **Duration:** 3-6 months continuous
- **Monitoring:** Regular assessment of IGF-1 levels
- **Adjustments:** Dose modifications based on response

## Clinical Monitoring

### Baseline Assessment
**Pre-Treatment Testing:**
- **IGF-1 levels:** Baseline growth factor measurement
- **Growth hormone stimulation test:** (in children)
- **Complete blood count:** Baseline hematology
- **Comprehensive metabolic panel:** Liver and kidney function

### Ongoing Monitoring
**Regular Assessments:**
- **IGF-1 levels:** Every 3-6 months
- **Growth velocity:** In pediatric patients
- **Side effect monitoring:** Ongoing assessment
- **Clinical response:** Sleep, energy, body composition

## Expected Outcomes and Timeline

### Pediatric Patients
**Growth Response:**
- **Initial Response:** 3-6 months for growth acceleration
- **Optimal Response:** 6-12 months for full effect
- **Monitoring:** Growth velocity measurements
- **Duration:** Until growth plates close

### Adult Anti-Aging Use
**Timeline for Benefits:**
- **Sleep Improvement:** 1-2 weeks
- **Energy Increase:** 2-4 weeks
- **Body Composition:** 3-6 months
- **Skin Quality:** 3-6 months

## Safety Profile

### Common Side Effects
**Injection Site Reactions:**

## Combination Therapy

### GHRP Combination
**Synergistic Combinations:**
- **Sermorelin + GHRP-2:** Enhanced GH release

## Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **FDA Approval:** Sermorelin is FDA-approved only for growth hormone deficiency in children. Adult anti-aging use is off-label.

⚠️ **Medical Supervision:** Both pediatric and adult use should be under qualified medical supervision with appropriate monitoring.

⚠️ **Individual Response:** Effects vary significantly between individuals. Regular monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary.

⚠️ **Long-term Safety:** While generally well-tolerated, long-term safety data for adult anti-aging use is limited.
