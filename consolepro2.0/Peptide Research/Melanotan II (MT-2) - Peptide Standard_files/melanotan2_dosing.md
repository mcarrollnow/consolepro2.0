# MELANOTAN II (MT-2) Dosing Schedule & Clinical Guidelines

## Overview
Melanotan II (MT-2) is a synthetic analog of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) that stimulates melanogenesis and has been studied for skin tanning, erectile dysfunction, and appetite suppression. **Important:** MT-2 is not approved by the FDA for human use and is considered an unregulated research chemical with significant safety concerns.

## Research-Based Dosing Protocols

### Loading Phase (Tanning)
Based on research studies and clinical observations:

**Conservative Loading Protocol:**
- **Week 1:** 0.25 mg daily
- **Week 2:** 0.5 mg daily  
- **Week 3-4:** 0.75-1.0 mg daily
- **Duration:** Until desired pigmentation achieved

**Standard Loading Protocol:**
- **Daily Dose:** 0.5-1.0 mg daily
- **Duration:** 2-4 weeks
- **Administration:** Subcutaneous injection
- **UV Exposure:** Minimal UV required

### Maintenance Phase
Once desired tanning level achieved:

**Maintenance Dosing:**
- **Frequency:** 2-3 times per week
- **Dose:** 0.5-1.0 mg per injection
- **Duration:** As needed to maintain tan
- **Monitoring:** Adjust based on pigmentation response

## Clinical Research Dosing

### Erectile Dysfunction Studies
Research protocols for sexual dysfunction:

**Clinical Trial Dosing:**
- **Dose Range:** 0.025 mg/kg body weight
- **Typical Dose:** 1.75-2.0 mg per administration
- **Timing:** 1-3 hours before sexual activity
- **Route:** Subcutaneous injection
- **Frequency:** As needed basis

### Appetite Suppression Research
Studies investigating metabolic effects:

**Research Protocol:**
- **Dose:** 0.5-1.0 mg daily
- **Duration:** Variable study periods
- **Monitoring:** Weight, appetite, food intake
- **Route:** Subcutaneous administration

## Administration Guidelines

### Injection Technique
**Preparation:**
1. Reconstitute with bacteriostatic water
2. Typical concentration: 10mg in 2-3ml water
3. Store reconstituted solution refrigerated

**Injection Process:**
- **Route:** Subcutaneous only
- **Sites:** Abdomen, thigh, or upper arm
- **Rotation:** Use different sites each injection
- **Needle:** Insulin syringe (29-31 gauge)

### Reconstitution Calculations
For 10mg vial with 2ml bacteriostatic water:
- **Concentration:** 5mg/ml
- **0.5mg dose:** 0.1ml (10 units on insulin syringe)
- **1.0mg dose:** 0.2ml (20 units on insulin syringe)

## Side Effects and Safety Concerns

### Common Side Effects
**Immediate Effects:**
- Nausea (very common, especially initial doses)
- Facial flushing
- Decreased appetite
- Spontaneous erections (males)
- Darkening of freckles and moles

**Skin-Related Effects:**
- Darkening of existing moles
- New freckle formation
- Uneven pigmentation
- Permanent skin darkening (potentially irreversible)

### Serious Safety Concerns

#### FDA Warnings
- **Not approved for human use**
- **Unregulated product quality**
- **Contamination risks**
- **Unknown long-term effects**

#### Potential Serious Effects
- **Melanoma risk:** Theoretical increased risk due to mole darkening
- **Cardiovascular effects:** Blood pressure changes
- **Hormonal disruption:** Effects on multiple hormone systems
- **Injection site infections:** Due to unsterile products

### Contraindications
- **Pregnancy and breastfeeding**
- **History of melanoma or skin cancer**
- **Multiple moles or atypical moles**
- **Cardiovascular disease**
- **Uncontrolled hypertension**

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Pre-Treatment Assessment
**Skin Examination:**
- Full body mole mapping
- Photography of existing moles
- Dermatology consultation recommended
- Assessment of skin type and cancer risk

**Medical Evaluation:**
- Cardiovascular assessment
- Blood pressure monitoring
- Review of medical history
- Discussion of risks vs. benefits

### Monitoring During Use
**Regular Assessments:**
- Weekly skin examination
- Mole size and color monitoring
- Blood pressure checks
- Side effect documentation

**Professional Monitoring:**
- Dermatology follow-ups
- Mole surveillance
- Skin cancer screening
- Photography comparison

## Dosing Considerations

### Individual Factors
**Skin Type Considerations:**
- **Skin Type I-II:** Lower doses, increased monitoring
- **Skin Type III-IV:** Standard dosing protocols
- **Skin Type V-VI:** May require higher doses for effect

**Body Weight Factors:**
- Larger individuals may require higher doses
- Start with lower doses regardless of weight
- Titrate based on response, not just weight

### UV Exposure Guidelines
**Minimal UV Required:**
- MT-2 enhances melanogenesis without significant UV
- Excessive UV exposure increases melanoma risk
- Brief, controlled sun exposure recommended
- Sunscreen still recommended

## Quality and Sourcing Concerns

### Product Variability
**Unregulated Market Issues:**
- **Purity varies significantly** between sources
- **Contamination risks** with unregulated products
- **Underdosing or overdosing** due to mislabeling
- **Bacterial contamination** in reconstitution supplies

### Safety Recommendations
**If Considering Use:**
- Source from reputable research chemical suppliers
- Third-party testing for purity when possible
- Sterile reconstitution techniques
- Medical supervision strongly recommended

## Legal and Regulatory Status

### Regulatory Classification
- **FDA Status:** Not approved for human use
- **Legal Status:** Generally legal as research chemical
- **Import Restrictions:** May vary by country
- **Sports Regulations:** May be prohibited in competitive sports

### Medical Supervision
**Strongly Recommended:**
- Healthcare provider consultation
- Risk assessment and monitoring
- Regular skin examinations
- Emergency action plan for adverse reactions

## Cycling and Discontinuation

### Treatment Cycles
**Typical Cycling:**
- **Loading Phase:** 2-4 weeks
- **Maintenance Phase:** Ongoing as needed
- **Rest Periods:** Some users cycle off periodically
- **Seasonal Use:** Often used before summer months

### Discontinuation Effects
**Post-Treatment:**
- **Tan Fading:** Gradual return to baseline pigmentation
- **Appetite Return:** Normal appetite typically returns
- **Nausea Resolution:** Side effects resolve quickly
- **Permanent Changes:** Mole darkening may be permanent

## Alternative Considerations

### Safer Alternatives
**FDA-Approved Options:**
- **Sunless tanning products** (dihydroxyacetone-based)
- **Professional spray tans**
- **Bronzing cosmetics**
- **Careful sun exposure with protection**

**For Erectile Dysfunction:**
