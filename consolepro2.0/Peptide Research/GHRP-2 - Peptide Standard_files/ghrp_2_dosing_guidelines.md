# GHRP-2 Clinical Dosing Guidelines

## Overview
GHRP-2 (Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide-2) is a synthetic hexapeptide that stimulates growth hormone release through the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). It is one of the most potent growth hormone releasing peptides with demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials.

## Clinical Research Summary
Based on clinical trials and research studies, GHRP-2 has demonstrated efficacy in:
- Growth hormone deficiency treatment
- Enhanced growth hormone secretion (7-15x baseline)
- Improved body composition and muscle growth
- Enhanced appetite and food intake
- Age-related growth hormone decline
- Metabolic function improvement

- **Option 1**: 0.1 mg/ml (dilute 5 mg in 50 ml bacteriostatic water)
- **Option 2**: 0.2 mg/ml (dilute 5 mg in 25 ml bacteriostatic water)
- **Option 3**: 0.5 mg/ml (dilute 5 mg in 10 ml bacteriostatic water)

### Storage
