# IGF-1 LR3 Dosing Schedule & Clinical Guidelines

## Overview
IGF-1 LR3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Long R3) is a synthetic analog of IGF-1 with an extended half-life due to amino acid substitutions that reduce binding to IGF-binding proteins. While IGF-1 has therapeutic applications, IGF-1 LR3 is primarily used in research settings and is not FDA-approved for human use. It carries significant safety concerns and regulatory restrictions.
