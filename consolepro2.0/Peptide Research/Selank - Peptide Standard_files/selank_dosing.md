# SELANK Dosing Schedule & Clinical Guidelines

## Overview
SELANK is a synthetic heptapeptide (TKPRPGP) based on the immunomodulatory peptide tuftsin. It was developed by the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Russian Academy of Sciences as a nootropic and anxiolytic compound. SELANK has been studied for its effects on anxiety, memory, and cognitive enhancement.

## Standard Dosing Guidelines

### Clinical Trial Dosing
In clinical trials, SELANK has been given as intranasal drops for up to 21 days in doses of up to 2700mcg (36 drops), split in three daily administrations.

### Injectable Dosing
Dr. William Seeds (2020) determined that an injectable SELANK dose of 100 mcg-300 mcg/daily was appropriate and well-tolerated by most human subjects.

**Typical Daily Dosing:**
- **Low Dose:** 100-200 mcg per day
- **Standard Dose:** 200-300 mcg per day
- **High Dose:** 300-500 mcg per day
- **Maximum Dose:** Up to 1000 mcg per day (nasal administration)

## Administration Methods

### Intranasal Administration (Preferred for Clinical Trials)
SELANK products are typically available as a 0.15% spray, which translates to approximately 75 μg (micrograms) of SELANK per spray.

**Nasal Spray Protocol:**
- **Standard Dose:** 2-3 sprays per dose
- **Frequency:** Up to 3 doses per day
- **Maximum Daily:** 675 μg/day (9 sprays total)
- **Timing:** Split doses throughout the day

### Subcutaneous Injection
For injectable SELANK, start at the lowest effective dose and increase as needed.

**Injection Protocol:**
- **Starting Dose:** 300 mcg daily
- **Frequency:** Daily or 2-3 times per week
- **Timing:** Can be administered morning or evening
- **Maintenance:** 500-1000 mcg for enhanced effects

### N-Acetyl SELANK Amidate
This stabilized version is more potent than regular SELANK and may require lower dosing.

## Treatment Duration

### Clinical Study Durations
- **Standard Cycles:** Up to 21 days in clinical trials
- **Extended Use:** Some studies have used SELANK for up to 3 months
- **Caution:** Long-term safety data is limited

### Dosing Frequency Options
**Daily Administration:**
- Consistent daily dosing for anxiety management
- Best for cognitive enhancement protocols

**Intermittent Dosing:**
- 2-3 times per week for maintenance
- Cycling off periodically to assess ongoing benefits

## Mechanism-Specific Effects

### Anxiolytic Effects
Animal studies using 300 micrograms/kg demonstrated significant anxiety reduction without sedation or negative cognitive effects.

### Cognitive Enhancement
SELANK injection during memory consolidation led to increased memory trace stability over 30 days in animal studies.

### GABA System Modulation
Clinical studies show similarity between SELANK and classical benzodiazepines (diazepam, phenazepam) but without associated side effects like amnesia, withdrawal, or dependence.

## Safety Profile

### General Tolerability
- **Well-tolerated:** No significant side effects reported in clinical trials
- **No addiction potential:** Unlike benzodiazepines
- **No sedation:** Does not cause drowsiness
- **No withdrawal:** No dependence or withdrawal symptoms

### Rare Side Effects (Intranasal)
- Mild nasal irritation
- Temporary nasal congestion
- Local discomfort (minimized with proper administration)

### Half-Life Considerations
SELANK has a very short half-life of only two minutes, meaning half of it is removed from circulation every two minutes. It becomes entirely undetectable in blood after just 10 minutes.

## Dosing Protocols

### Anxiety Management Protocol
- **Week 1-2:** 300 mcg daily (intranasal or injection)
- **Week 3-4:** Adjust dose based on response (200-500 mcg)
- **Maintenance:** Continue effective dose or cycle as needed

### Cognitive Enhancement Protocol
- **Daily Dose:** 200-300 mcg
- **Timing:** Morning administration preferred
- **Duration:** 2-4 week cycles with breaks

### Research Protocol (Animal Studies)
- **Standard Dose:** 300 μg/kg in animal studies
- **Administration:** Post-learning for memory consolidation
- **Frequency:** Daily during active learning periods

## Special Considerations

### Individual Factors
- **Body Weight:** Dose may be adjusted based on weight
- **Age:** Younger patients may metabolize more efficiently
- **Tolerance:** Start low and assess individual response

### Contraindications
- **Pregnancy/Nursing:** Limited safety data available
- **Children:** Generally not recommended without specialist guidance
- **Immune Disorders:** Caution advised due to immunomodulatory effects

### Drug Interactions
Limited research on potential interactions exists. Caution advised when combining with:
- Other nootropics
- Anxiety medications
- Immune system medications

## Administration Guidelines

### Injection Technique
- **Route:** Subcutaneous or intramuscular
- **Sites:** Rotate injection sites
- **Preparation:** Proper sterile technique required

### Nasal Administration
- **Technique:** Avoid blowing nose immediately after administration
- **Timing:** Allow proper absorption time
- **Storage:** Follow manufacturer guidelines

## Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **Regulatory Status:** SELANK's legal status varies by country. In many regions, it's available as a research chemical only.

⚠️ **Limited Human Data:** While some clinical trials exist, comprehensive long-term human studies are limited.

⚠️ **Quality Concerns:** Source from reputable suppliers with proper testing and documentation.

⚠️ **Professional Guidance:** Always consult healthcare providers before starting SELANK therapy.
