# HGH (Human Growth Hormone) Dosing Schedule & Clinical Guidelines

## Overview
Human Growth Hormone (HGH), also known as somatropin, is a recombinant form of naturally occurring growth hormone. It's FDA-approved for various growth disorders in children and specific conditions in adults including growth hormone deficiency, muscle wasting, and short bowel syndrome. HGH is a prescription medication requiring medical supervision.
