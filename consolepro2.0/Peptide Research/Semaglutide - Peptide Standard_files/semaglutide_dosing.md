# SEMAGLUTIDE Dosing Schedule & Clinical Guidelines

## Overview
Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist approved by the FDA under three brand names: Ozempic® (Type 2 diabetes), Wegovy® (weight management), and Rybelsus® (oral diabetes treatment). The dosing varies significantly based on indication and individual patient needs.

## Standard Dose Escalation Schedule

### Weight Management (Wegovy®) - 2.4mg Maximum
The standard dosing regimen involves gradual titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects:

**Week 1-4:** 0.25 mg once weekly (starting dose)
**Week 5-8:** 0.5 mg once weekly
**Week 9-12:** 1.0 mg once weekly
**Week 13-16:** 1.7 mg once weekly
**Week 17+:** 2.4 mg once weekly (maintenance dose)

### Type 2 Diabetes (Ozempic®) - 2.0mg Maximum
For diabetes management, the therapeutic dose typically ranges between 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg weekly:

**Week 1-4:** 0.25 mg once weekly
**Week 5-8:** 0.5 mg once weekly
**Week 9+:** 1.0 mg once weekly (can increase to 2.0 mg if needed)

## Microdosing Protocol

### Conservative Approach
Microdosing is beneficial for patients who are highly sensitive to medications, first-time users, or those with lower BMI:

**Week 1-4:** 0.05 mg weekly
**Week 5-8:** 0.1 mg weekly
**Week 9-12:** 0.15 mg weekly
**Continue:** Gradually increase by 0.1 mg every 4 weeks until reaching effective dose

### Benefits of Microdosing
- Reduces risk of side effects, particularly nausea and vomiting
- Improves medication adherence
- Allows for more personalized treatment plans
- **Drawback:** May delay therapeutic results as it takes longer to reach effective dose

## Clinical Trial Dosing

### STEP Program (Weight Management)
The global phase 3 STEP program evaluated semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly:
- **STEP 1:** 68-week trial in adults with obesity showed mean weight reduction of -14.9% vs -2.4% with placebo
- **Dose:** 2.4 mg subcutaneous once weekly
- **Results:** Treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points vs placebo

### SUSTAIN Program (Diabetes)
The SUSTAIN clinical trials demonstrated favorable outcomes in reducing HbA1c in patients with Type 2 diabetes through weekly subcutaneous semaglutide.

## Administration Methods

### Subcutaneous Injection
**Sites:** Abdomen, thigh, or upper arm
**Frequency:** Once weekly, same day each week
**Timing:** Can be taken any time of day, with or without food
**Needle:** Use NovoFine® needles up to 8mm length

### Schedule Flexibility
You may change the day of the week as long as your last dose was taken 2 or more days before.

### Missed Dose Guidelines
**≤5 days late:** Administer as soon as possible, then resume regular schedule
**>5 days late:** Skip missed dose and administer next dose on regularly scheduled day

## Dose Adjustments and Tolerance

### Poor Tolerance Management
If patients do not tolerate a dose during escalation:
- Consider a 4-week delay in dose escalation
- For maintenance dose intolerance: decrease to 1.7 mg for 4 weeks, then re-escalate
- **Permanent intolerance:** Discontinue if unable to tolerate maintenance dosing

### Pediatric Dosing (≥12 years for Wegovy®)
Similar to adult dosing with exceptions:
- **If 2.4 mg not tolerated:** Maintenance dose may be reduced to 1.7 mg indefinitely
- **If 1.7 mg not tolerated:** Discontinue semaglutide

## Compounded Semaglutide Dosing

### Flexible Dosing Options
Compounded semaglutide offers more dosing flexibility:
- **Starting dose:** As low as 0.15 mg per week
- **Customization:** Personalized dose escalation schedules
- **Administration:** Measured from vials using single-use syringes
- **Adjustments:** Small dose modifications possible based on individual response

## Long-Term Maintenance

### Sustained Results
Once therapeutic goals are achieved, maintain results with:
- **Consistent dosing:** Same day each week
- **Lifestyle integration:** Combined with reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity
- **Regular monitoring:** Healthcare provider assessments for continued efficacy

### Treatment Duration
- **Weight management:** Long-term therapy for chronic condition
- **Diabetes:** Ongoing treatment as part of diabetes management plan
- **Monitoring:** Regular HbA1c and weight assessments

## Safety Profile and Side Effects

### Common Gastrointestinal Effects
**Most frequent (>10%):**
- Nausea (up to 44% with Wegovy®)
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Constipation
- Abdominal pain

**Management:** These effects typically decrease as the body adjusts to higher doses.

### Serious Considerations

#### Thyroid C-Cell Tumors
- **Black Box Warning:** Risk of thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents
- **Contraindication:** Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)
- **Contraindication:** Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2)

#### Pancreatitis Risk
- Monitor for symptoms of acute pancreatitis
- Consider other therapies in patients with history of pancreatitis
- Discontinue if pancreatitis suspected

#### Diabetic Retinopathy
- Monitor patients with Type 2 diabetes and history of diabetic retinopathy
- Rapid improvement in blood glucose control may worsen diabetic retinopathy

## Drug Interactions and Contraindications

### Contraindications
- Serious hypersensitivity to semaglutide or excipients
- Personal or family history of MTC
- Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2
- **Pregnancy:** Discontinue 2 months before planned pregnancy

### Drug Interactions
- **Insulin:** Administer as separate injections, never mix
- **Oral medications:** May delay gastric emptying, affecting absorption
- **Other GLP-1 agonists:** Do not coadminister

## Special Populations

### Renal Impairment
- Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses
- Acute kidney injury reported with severe GI reactions

### Hepatic Impairment
- **Severe liver disease:** Use with caution
- Monitor for signs of hepatic dysfunction

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
- **Pregnancy Category:** No adequate human studies
- **Breastfeeding:** Unknown if present in human milk
- **Recommendation:** Discontinue 2 months before planned pregnancy

## Monitoring Parameters

### Efficacy Monitoring
**Weight Management:**
- Body weight changes
- Waist circumference
- BMI calculations
- Quality of life assessments

**Diabetes Management:**
- HbA1c levels (baseline and during treatment)
- Fasting and postprandial glucose
- Blood pressure
- Lipid profile

### Safety Monitoring
- Signs/symptoms of pancreatitis
