# NAD+ Dosing Schedule & Clinical Guidelines

## Overview
NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a critical coenzyme involved in cellular energy production, DNA repair, and aging processes. NAD+ levels naturally decline with age, leading to interest in supplementation for anti-aging and health optimization. Clinical trials are ongoing to establish optimal dosing protocols.

## NAD+ Precursor Oral Supplementation

### Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)
Research typically uses doses ranging from 100mg to 1000mg daily, with most studies centering around 250mg to 500mg per day. These amounts have been shown to effectively increase NAD levels while maintaining a strong safety profile.

**Standard NR Dosing:**
- **Low Dose:** 100-250 mg daily
- **Standard Dose:** 250-500 mg daily
- **High Dose:** 500-1000 mg daily

### Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)
A systematic review of randomized controlled trials found that NMN dosages ranged from 150 to 1200 mg per day. Studies using 250-900 mg/day of NMN supplementation showed significant improvements in blood NAD concentration.

**Standard NMN Dosing:**
- **Low Dose:** 150-250 mg daily
- **Standard Dose:** 250-500 mg daily
- **High Dose:** 500-900 mg daily
- **Research Range:** Up to 1200 mg daily

### Nicotinamide (NAM)
NAM is well-tolerated at doses up to 3 g per day, even during long-term administration. A single oral dose of NAM within the daily tolerable upper level (900 mg for adults) significantly increased blood NAD+ levels in healthy subjects.

**Standard NAM Dosing:**
- **Low Dose:** 300-500 mg daily
- **Standard Dose:** 500-900 mg daily
- **High Dose:** 900-3000 mg daily

## NAD+ Injection Protocols

### Subcutaneous Injection Dosing
Most clinical practice guidelines suggest starting with lower doses and gradually increasing based on tolerance and response.

**Standard Injection Protocol:**
- **Starting Dose:** 25-50 mg per injection
- **Standard Dose:** 50-200 mg per injection
- **Frequency:** 1-3 times per week initially
- **Maintenance:** Adjust based on individual response

### Clinical Trial Dosing
The typical dosage of NAD+ used in clinical studies ranges from 100 to 300 mg per day, given as one or more infusions over several days.

**Research Protocol:**
- **Week 1-4:** 25 units once to three times per week
- **Maintenance:** Adjust frequency and dose based on response
- **Duration:** Varies by individual needs and goals

## NAD+ IV Therapy Protocols

### Intravenous Administration
IV protocols typically use higher doses, ranging from 500mg to 1500mg per session, delivered over several hours. The gradual administration helps minimize potential side effects like flushing or nausea.

**Standard IV Protocol:**
- **Low Dose:** 500 mg per session
- **Standard Dose:** 750-1000 mg per session
- **High Dose:** 1000-1500 mg per session
- **Frequency:** Weekly to monthly depending on goals

### Treatment Programs
Treatment programs often start with a series of consecutive daily sessions (typically 3-10 days) followed by maintenance sessions scheduled weeks or months apart.

**Initial Loading Phase:**
- **Days 1-3:** 500-750 mg daily IV
- **Days 4-7:** 750-1000 mg daily IV
- **Maintenance:** 500-1000 mg weekly to monthly

### Historical Protocol (1961 Study)
According to a 1961 study, patients received NAD+ at a moderate IV drip rate (no more than 35 drops per minute). The dosage was 500–1000 mg per day for 4 days, then two injections every week for a month, and then one injection every two months as a maintenance dose.

## Combination Therapy

### NR + Pterostilbene
Clinical trials have studied combination therapy of NR with the polyphenol pterostilbene, hoping to increase NAD+ abundance and enhance sirtuin enzyme activity.

**Combination Dosing:**
- **Low Dose:** 250 mg NR + 50 mg pterostilbene daily
- **High Dose:** 500 mg NR + 100 mg pterostilbene daily

Studies suggest greater clinical efficacy with the lower dose combination, with improvements in select markers of cardiovascular, liver, pulmonary, and muscular function.

## Administration Guidelines

### Timing Considerations
- **Daily Consistency:** NAD precursors work best when taken consistently every day
- **Morning vs Evening:** Most people prefer taking NAD boosters in the morning since they can promote energy production
- **With/Without Food:** Most forms tolerate well with or without food

### Reconstitution Instructions
**500mg Vial:** Add 5mL of Bacteriostatic Water
**1000mg Vial:** Add 10mL of Bacteriostatic Water
**Storage:** Refrigerate reconstituted vials; use within 30 days

## Safety Profile

### General Safety
No study reported severe side effects in clinical trials, supporting the thesis that these interventions are likely to be relatively safe for human use. Multiple widely used over-the-counter supplements increase NAD levels, including niacin, NR, and NMN.

### Potential Side Effects
**High-Dose Reactions:**
- Nausea (especially with IV administration)
- Headache
- Shortness of breath (with rapid IV administration)
- Constipation (rare)

**Injection Site Reactions:**
- Local redness or swelling
- Mild discomfort at injection site

### Contraindications
- **Pregnancy/Breastfeeding:** Limited safety data available
- **Cardiovascular Disease:** Monitor blood pressure with IV administration
- **Kidney Disease:** Caution with high doses

## Special Populations

### Aging Adults
NAD+ supplementation may ameliorate aspects of age-related immunosenescence and inflammaging, protect against viral disease, and help the elderly mount an immune response to vaccines.

### Parkinson's Disease
A 2023 early-stage clinical trial found that a high dose of NR (1500 milligrams twice daily) improved NAD levels and certain Parkinson's symptoms.

### Addiction Recovery
In clinical settings, NAD+ injections are often used as part of addiction recovery programs, with higher doses administered daily over several weeks to help reduce cravings and support brain health.

## Monitoring and Adjustments

### Response Indicators
- **Energy levels:** Improved cellular energy production
- **Sleep quality:** Enhanced recovery and repair
- **Cognitive function:** Better mental clarity and focus
- **Physical performance:** Enhanced endurance and recovery

### Dose Adjustments
- Start with lower doses to assess tolerance
- Gradually increase based on individual response
- Monitor for side effects, especially gastrointestinal
- Adjust frequency based on therapeutic goals

## Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **FDA Status:** NAD+ is considered a dietary supplement, not a drug. The FDA does not currently evaluate dietary supplements in their current regulations.

⚠️ **Clinical Evidence:** While research on NAD+ supplementation is ongoing, comprehensive long-term human studies are still needed.

⚠️ **Professional Guidance:** Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before starting any NAD+ supplementation regimen.

⚠️ **Quality Assurance:** Source NAD+ products from reputable suppliers with third-party testing and proper documentation.
