# BPC-157 Dosing Schedule & Clinical Guidelines

## Overview
BPC-157 (Body Protective Compound-157) is a synthetic pentadecapeptide derived from human gastric juice. The FDA does not approve BPC-157 for human use, and its safety and efficacy have not been established through large-scale clinical trials. All dosing information is based on animal studies and preclinical research.

## Standard Dosing Guidelines

### Research-Based Dosing
Animal research exploring the healing capabilities of BPC-157 has mostly involved rodents, with doses reaching up to 10mcg/kg daily. To calculate a comparable dosage to apply in clinical settings, researchers may refer to the dose conversion guidelines established by Nair et al. (2016). Based on this publication, the conversion rate from rat to human doses is about 1:6.2. Therefore, a rat dosage of 10mcg/kg translates to roughly 1.61mcg/kg for human subjects. This equates to approximately 0.73mcg/lb, or about 146mcg for an individual weighing 200lb.

### Clinical Practice Guidelines
As a daily dosage guideline, some preliminary studies have suggested between 200 and 800 micrograms per day. The specific number depends on your weight and the condition you're treating.

**Typical Daily Dosing:**
- **Low Dose:** 200-400 mcg per day
- **Standard Dose:** 400-600 mcg per day  
- **High Dose:** 600-800 mcg per day

### Administration Methods

#### Subcutaneous Injection (Preferred)
While oral administration can work fine, injections are better absorbed by the body, making them the superior option for achieving positive effects.

**Injection Protocol:**
- **Single Daily Dose:** Administer full dose once daily
- **Divided Dose:** Split into 2 equal doses (morning and evening)
- **Example:** For 400 mcg daily dose: 200 mcg morning + 200 mcg evening

#### Oral Administration
Preclinical experiments reveal that BPC-157 may also be administered orally, such as in the form of BPC-157 capsules, especially during research related to gut health.

## Treatment Duration

### Standard Cycle Length
Animal studies have administered BPC-157 for periods exceeding 14 days without observing any significant safety concerns or adverse effects.

**Typical Treatment Protocols:**
- **Acute Healing:** 2-4 weeks
- **Chronic Conditions:** 4-8 weeks
- **Maintenance:** As needed basis

### Clinical Trial Dosing
According to our previous pharmacodynamic results in rats and mice, our recommended dosage for clinical trials is 200 μg/person/day (3.33 μg/kg/day) for 7 days. The medication route is intramuscular injection (i.m.).

## Safety Profile

### General Safety
Since BPC-157 is derived from human gastric juices, it's tolerated remarkably well. Risk of any kind of adverse reaction is slim, and there is no evidence to suggest significant side effects.

### Preclinical Safety Data
BPC157 was well tolerated and did not cause any serious toxicity in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs. These preclinical safety data contribute to the initiation of an ongoing clinical study.

### Pharmacokinetics
The elimination half-life (t1/2) of prototype BPC157 was less than 30 min, and BPC157 showed linear pharmacokinetic characteristics in rats and beagle dogs at all doses. The mean absolute bioavailability of BPC157 following IM injection was approximately 14%–19% in rats and 45%–51% in beagle dogs.

## Dosing Considerations

### Individual Factors
- **Body Weight:** Base dosing on mcg/kg calculations
- **Condition Severity:** Adjust dose based on therapeutic needs
- **Response:** Start with lower doses and titrate up
- **Tolerance:** Monitor for individual response patterns

### Professional Guidance
First and foremost, we recommend always talking with a medical professional before you start taking any kind of supplement or synthetic peptide. Your doctor will be able to tell you whether the potential benefits align with your personal health and wellness needs, and also provide more information about potential side effects for you to be aware of.

## Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **Clinical Status:** Currently, BPC-157 is not authorized for human use as it lacks approval for any indication. The correct dosage for use outside of laboratory environments is still undetermined.

⚠️ **Research Context:** All dosing information is extrapolated from animal studies and preclinical research. Human clinical trials are limited.

⚠️ **Quality Concerns:** Particular attention should be paid to possible side effects linked to the method of administration, like subcutaneous injections, which might cause local reactions such as redness, swelling, or irritation.
