# GHK-Cu (Copper Peptide) Dosing Schedule & Clinical Guidelines

## Overview
GHK-Cu (Glycyl-L-Histidyl-L-Lysine-Copper) is a naturally occurring copper complex tripeptide found in human plasma, saliva, and urine. Discovered in 1973, it has strong affinity for copper(II) and plays a crucial role in wound healing, tissue remodeling, and anti-aging processes. Plasma levels decline significantly with age, from 200 ng/ml at age 20 to 80 ng/ml by age 60.

## Injectable Dosing Protocols

### Standard Subcutaneous Injection
Researchers and clinicians typically administer 1-2mg daily of GHK-Cu over the course of a 30-day treatment to achieve desirable outcomes on skin, hair growth, and systemic healing.

**Standard Injectable Protocol:**
- **Starting Dose:** 1 mg per day subcutaneously
- **Standard Range:** 1-2 mg daily
- **Duration:** 30-day treatment cycles
- **Frequency:** Daily administration during treatment cycle

### Clinical Practice Dosing
The injectable GHK-Cu suggested dosage based on clinical protocols:

**Standard Clinical Dosing:**
- **Concentration:** 10 mg/mL injection in 5 mL vial
- **Daily Dose:** 0.2 mL delivered subcutaneously (2 mg)
- **Frequency:** Once per day
- **Administration:** Rotate injection sites to prevent irritation

### Research-Based Animal Studies
C57BL/6 male mice (28 months old) were treated with GHK at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight 5 times per week for three weeks, showing improved learning compared to saline-treated controls.

**Animal Study Translation:**
- **Dose:** 10 mg/kg body weight in mice
- **Frequency:** 5 times per week
- **Duration:** 3 weeks
- **Results:** Significant cognitive improvement in spatial navigation

## Topical Application Dosing

### Facial and Skin Applications
For cosmetic and anti-aging applications, topical formulations are widely used with established concentration ranges.

**Topical Concentrations:**
- **Low Concentration:** 2% GHK-Cu (eye serums, sensitive areas)
- **Standard Concentration:** 4% GHK-Cu (daily face/neck application)
- **High Concentration:** Up to 10% GHK-Cu (targeted treatments)

### Topical Foam for Scalp
**Hair Growth Protocol:**
- **Concentration:** 5 mg/mL (0.05%)
- **Application:** 2-3 pumps applied to scalp
- **Frequency:** Once nightly
- **Duration:** Continuous use for hair growth maintenance

### Clinical Trial Topical Dosing
A randomized, double-blind clinical trial had female volunteers apply GHK-Cu encapsulated in nano-lipid carrier twice daily for 8 weeks.

**Clinical Trial Protocol:**
- **Frequency:** Twice daily application
- **Duration:** 8 weeks
- **Formulation:** Nano-lipid carrier encapsulation
- **Results:** Increased skin thickness, improved hydration, enhanced collagen synthesis

## Hair Growth Applications

### Topical Hair Solutions
For hair growth applications, concentrations have varied significantly in research protocols:

**Hair Growth Concentrations:**
- **Research Range:** 50-100 mg/mL solutions
- **Combined Therapy:** GHK + 5-aminolevulinic acid
- **Application:** Applied to affected scalp areas
- **Clinical Product:** GraftCyte (GHK-Cu containing) proven effective for hair transplant outcomes

## Oral Administration

### Liposomal Formulations
Regular oral forms without liposomal encapsulation are ineffective as the peptide breaks down in the intestines.

**Oral Dosing Requirements:**
- **Minimum Effective:** 10 mg daily (liposomal delivery)
- **Standard Capsules:** 100-200 mcg daily (limited effectiveness)
- **Note:** Requires special formulation to prevent digestive breakdown

### Bioavailability Considerations
- **Injectable:** High bioavailability and systemic effects
- **Topical:** Effective for localized skin and hair benefits
- **Oral:** Requires liposomal encapsulation for effectiveness

## Concentration Calculations

### Injectable Concentration Formula
For peptide calculation with standard 5mg vial in 5mL bacteriostatic water:

**Concentration:** 1 mg/mL (1000 mcg/mL)
**For 250 mcg dose:** 0.25 mL (25 units on insulin syringe)
**For 500 mcg dose:** 0.5 mL (50 units on insulin syringe)
**For 1 mg dose:** 1.0 mL (100 units on insulin syringe)

### Alternative Concentration
For 10mg vial in 5mL:
**Concentration:** 2 mg/mL (2000 mcg/mL)
**For 1 mg dose:** 0.5 mL (50 units on insulin syringe)
**For 2 mg dose:** 1.0 mL (100 units on insulin syringe)

## Cellular and Molecular Dosing

### In Vitro Research Concentrations
Laboratory studies have used specific nanomolar concentrations to study cellular effects:

**Cellular Research Dosing:**
- **Low Dose:** 0.01 nM (increased MMP1 and MMP2 gene expression)
- **Medium Dose:** 1 nM (increased elastin and collagen production)
- **High Dose:** 100 nM (continued collagen and elastin increase)

### Antioxidant Effects
Cells pretreated with GHK-Cu at concentrations of 10 nM and 10 μM showed significant decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS).

## Systemic vs. Local Effects

### Systemic Enhancement
GHK-Cu has been found to induce systemic enhancement of healing - peptide injected in one area (thigh muscles) improved healing at distant body areas (ears).

**Systemic Protocol:**
- **Injection Site:** Any convenient subcutaneous location
- **Effect:** Body-wide healing enhancement
- **Mechanism:** Systemic circulation and tissue remodeling

### Local Application Benefits
Topical applications provide targeted benefits for specific areas:

**Local Benefits:**
- **Skin:** Improved firmness, reduced wrinkles, enhanced collagen
- **Hair:** Increased follicle size, improved thickness and growth
- **Wounds:** Accelerated healing, reduced inflammation

## Safety Profile and Side Effects

### General Safety
According to Dr. Pickart (discoverer of GHK-Cu): "No issues involving GHK-Cu have ever arisen during its use as a skin cosmetic or in human wound healing studies."

### Potential Side Effects
**Injectable Administration:**
- Injection site reactions (redness, swelling)
- Mild headache or nausea (rare)
- Blood pressure lowering at high doses

**Topical Application:**
- Mild skin irritation (sensitive individuals)
- Temporary redness at application site

### Contraindications and Precautions
**Avoid in:**
- Wilson's disease (copper overload condition)
- Metal sensitivities or copper allergies
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding
- Active malignancies (due to growth-promoting effects)

**Drug Interactions:**
- **Vitamin C:** Do not apply topical GHK-Cu simultaneously with Vitamin C products (copper counteracts Vitamin C's antioxidant properties)

## Treatment Cycles and Scheduling

### Injectable Cycles
**Standard Cycle:**
- **Treatment Phase:** 30 days of daily injections
- **Rest Phase:** 2-4 weeks off treatment
- **Repeat:** Based on individual response and goals

### Topical Maintenance
**Continuous Use:**
- **Daily Application:** For ongoing anti-aging benefits
- **Long-term Safety:** Well-established for cosmetic use
- **Monitoring:** Assess skin response and adjust concentration

## Age-Related Dosing Considerations

### Natural Decline Replacement
Since GHK-Cu levels decline with age, supplementation aims to restore youthful levels:

**Age-Based Approach:**
- **Young Adults (20-30):** Lower doses for preventive care
- **Middle Age (40-50):** Standard doses for maintenance
- **Older Adults (60+):** Higher doses to compensate for natural decline

## Quality and Administration Guidelines

### Professional Supervision
Injectable GHK-Cu treatment should be conducted under qualified healthcare professional supervision, ideally in clinical settings, to ensure appropriate dosing and minimize injection-related risks.

### Storage and Handling
- **Unreconstituted:** Store in cool, dry place
- **Reconstituted:** Refrigerate and use within recommended timeframe
- **Injection Technique:** Proper sterile technique required

## Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **Regulatory Status:** GHK-Cu may not be approved for therapeutic use without prescription in all regions. Check local regulations.

⚠️ **Professional Guidance:** Self-administration of injectables carries significant risks including infection and adverse reactions. Healthcare supervision is strongly recommended.

⚠️ **Individual Response:** Effects vary significantly between individuals. Start with lower doses and monitor response.

⚠️ **Quality Sourcing:** Ensure products are sourced from reputable suppliers with proper testing and documentation.
