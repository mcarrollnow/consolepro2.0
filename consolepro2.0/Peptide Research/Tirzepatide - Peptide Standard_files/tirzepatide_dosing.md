# TIRZEPATIDE Dosing Schedule & Clinical Guidelines

## Overview
Tirzepatide is a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist available under two FDA-approved brand names: Mounjaro® (for Type 2 diabetes) and Zepbound® (for weight management and obstructive sleep apnea). It works by activating both glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, providing superior weight loss and glycemic control compared to single-pathway medications.

## Standard Dose Escalation Schedule

### Initial Titration (All Indications)
Tirzepatide follows a gradual escalation schedule to minimize gastrointestinal side effects:

**Week 1-4:** 2.5 mg once weekly (starting dose)
**Week 5-8:** 5 mg once weekly  
**Week 9-12:** 7.5 mg once weekly
**Week 13-16:** 10 mg once weekly
**Week 17-20:** 12.5 mg once weekly
**Week 21+:** 15 mg once weekly (maximum dose)

### Key Escalation Principles
- **Minimum Duration:** 4 weeks at each dose level before increasing
- **Maximum Increase:** 2.5 mg increments only
- **Individual Tolerance:** Dose increases based on tolerance and clinical response
- **Side Effect Management:** May delay escalation if gastrointestinal side effects occur

## Indication-Specific Dosing

### Type 2 Diabetes (Mounjaro®)
**Standard Maintenance Doses:** 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, or 15 mg once weekly

**Clinical Trial Results (SURPASS-5):**
- **5 mg weekly:** -2.11% HbA1c reduction, 5.4 kg weight loss
- **15 mg weekly:** -2.34% HbA1c reduction, 10.5 kg weight loss
- **Duration:** Demonstrated over 40 weeks

### Weight Management (Zepbound®)
**Maintenance Doses:** 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg once weekly

**Clinical Trial Results (SURMOUNT-1, 72 weeks):**
- **5 mg weekly:** 15.0% mean weight reduction
- **10 mg weekly:** 19.5% mean weight reduction  
- **15 mg weekly:** 20.9% mean weight reduction
- **Placebo:** 3.1% weight reduction

**Weight Loss Thresholds:**
- **≥5% weight loss:** 85-91% of patients (vs 35% placebo)
- **≥20% weight loss:** 50-57% of patients (vs 3% placebo)

### Obstructive Sleep Apnea (Zepbound®)
**Recommended Maintenance:** 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly
**Indication:** Moderate to severe OSA in adults with obesity
**Protocol:** Start with standard escalation, titrate to 10-15 mg maintenance

## Administration Guidelines

### Injection Technique
**Route:** Subcutaneous injection
**Sites:** Abdomen, thigh, or upper arm

- Superior to other diabetes medications
- Dose-dependent glucose improvements
- Cardiovascular benefits demonstrated

### Sleep Apnea Improvement
**Clinical Benefits:**
- Reduced apnea-hypopnea index
- Improved sleep quality measures
- Weight loss-mediated improvements
- Enhanced quality of life scores

## Side Effect Management

### Common Gastrointestinal Effects
**Most Frequent (dose-related):**
- Nausea (up to 10% of patients)
- Diarrhea
- Decreased appetite
- Vomiting
- Acid reflux

**Management Strategies:**
- Gradual dose escalation
- Take with food if needed
- Stay hydrated
- Monitor nutrition intake
- Consider anti-nausea medications

### Injection Site Reactions
- Mild redness, swelling, or itching
- Rotate injection sites weekly
- Proper injection technique
- Monitor for persistent reactions

## Monitoring and Safety

### Regular Assessments
**Diabetes Patients:**
- HbA1c levels
- Blood glucose monitoring
- Diabetic retinopathy screening
- Kidney function tests

**Weight Management:**
- Body weight changes
- BMI calculations
- Waist circumference
- Blood pressure monitoring

### Laboratory Monitoring
- **Lipase/Amylase:** May be elevated asymptomatically
