# TESAMORELIN Dosing Schedule & Clinical Guidelines

## Overview
Tesamorelin is a synthetic 44-amino acid analog of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) that is FDA-approved for reducing excess visceral abdominal fat in HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy. It stimulates the release of endogenous growth hormone in a pulsatile fashion while maintaining physiological balance.

## FDA-Approved Dosing

### Standard Clinical Dose (Egrifta®)
The FDA-approved dosing for HIV-associated lipodystrophy:

**Standard Protocol:**
- **Daily Dose:** 2 mg once daily
- **Administration:** Subcutaneous injection
- **Timing:** Same time each day
- **Duration:** Continuous use for maintained benefits

### Egrifta WR™ (Weekly Reconstitution)
A newer formulation that offers improved convenience:

**Enhanced Protocol:**
- **Daily Dose:** 2 mg once daily (lower injection volume)
- **Reconstitution:** Weekly instead of daily
- **Advantage:** Improved compliance and convenience

## Clinical Trial Dosing Protocols

### Phase III HIV Lipodystrophy Studies
Clinical trials in HIV-infected patients with excess visceral adipose tissue (VAT):

**26-Week Protocol:**
- **Dose:** 2 mg daily subcutaneous injection
- **Results:** Significant reduction in VAT without affecting subcutaneous adipose tissue
- **Outcome:** Maintained benefits when continued to 52 weeks

**52-Week Extension:**
- **Continued Dose:** 2 mg daily
- **Additional Benefits:** Decreased triglyceride levels, increased IGF-1 levels
- **Safety:** No new adverse events identified

### Abdominal Obesity Studies
Research in non-HIV patients with abdominal obesity:

**12-Month Study Protocol:**
- **Participants:** 60 abdominally obese subjects with reduced GH secretion
- **Dose:** Up to 2 mg once daily
- **Duration:** 12 months
- **Results:** Significant reduction in abdominal fat

## Off-Label Research Dosing

### Cognitive Enhancement Studies
Limited research on cognitive benefits:

**Cognitive Protocol:**
- **Study Duration:** Variable based on research design
- **Population:** Elderly individuals with cognitive decline
- **Dosing:** Similar to standard 2 mg daily protocol

### Weight Loss Research
For researchers investigating weight loss applications:

**Initial Protocol:**
- **Starting Period:** Lower doses for first 4 weeks
- **Maintenance:** 2 mg daily thereafter
- **Monitoring:** Regular assessment of body composition

## Administration Guidelines

### Injection Technique
**Preparation:**
1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water
2. Reconstitute with provided bacteriostatic water
3. Swirl (don't shake) until completely dissolved
4. Check for particles or discoloration - discard if present

**Injection Process:**
- **Site:** Abdominal region, at least 2 inches from navel
- **Avoid:** Scarred, bruised, reddened, or irritated areas
- **Rotation:** Use different injection sites each day
- **Needle:** Use new needle and syringe each injection

### Timing Considerations
**Optimal Administration:**
- **Empty Stomach:** Take on empty stomach for best efficacy
- **Timing Options:**
  - Before bedtime (aligns with natural GH release)
  - Before or after intense workout
- **Avoid:** Administration with fats and carbohydrates (negatively impact efficacy)

## Dosage Calculations

### Standard Reconstitution
For typical 1 mg vials:

**Concentration:** 1 mg/mL when reconstituted properly
**Daily 2mg Dose:** Requires 2 mL injection volume

### Alternative Concentration Example
For 6 mg vial reconstituted with 2 mL bacteriostatic water:

**Concentration:** 3 mg/mL (3000 mcg/mL)
**For 1000 mcg (1 mg):** Draw 0.33 mL
**For 2000 mcg (2 mg):** Draw 0.67 mL

## Treatment Duration and Cycling

### Continuous Therapy
**FDA-Approved Use:**
- **Duration:** Ongoing treatment for maintained benefits
- **Monitoring:** Regular assessment of visceral fat reduction
- **Safety:** Long-term safety established in clinical trials

### Research Protocols
**Study-Based Cycling:**
- **Treatment Periods:** Varies by research design
- **Assessment Points:** Regular body composition evaluations
- **Adjustments:** Based on individual response and tolerance

## Combination Therapy

### Ipamorelin Stacking
Tesamorelin is often combined with Ipamorelin for synergistic effects:

**Combination Benefits:**
- **Enhanced GH release:** Complementary mechanisms
- **Improved efficacy:** Synergistic fat loss effects
- **Dosing:** Maintain standard tesamorelin dose with appropriate Ipamorelin dosing

### Athletic Performance Context
**Note:** While used off-label, not supported by clinical evidence:
- **WADA Status:** Prohibited in competitive sports
- **Legal:** Subject to ethical, legal, and medical constraints
- **Safety:** Long-term risks in healthy individuals unknown

## Safety Profile and Monitoring

### Common Side Effects
**Injection Site Reactions:**
- Redness, swelling, or irritation
- Pain or tenderness at injection site
- Bruising or hematoma formation

**Systemic Effects:**
- Arthralgia (joint pain)
- Myalgia (muscle pain)
- Peripheral edema
- Headache

### Serious Considerations

#### IGF-1 Monitoring
- **Requirement:** Regular IGF-1 level monitoring during therapy
- **Risk:** Potential stimulation of malignant tumor growth
- **Precaution:** Ensure inactive malignancy status before initiation

#### Glucose Metabolism
- **Risk:** Glucose intolerance and diabetes development
- **Monitoring:** Regular blood glucose assessments
- **Management:** Adjust diabetes medications as needed

#### Hypersensitivity Reactions
- **Symptoms:** Difficulty swallowing, fast heartbeat, skin reactions
- **Severity:** Can be life-threatening
- **Action:** Immediate medical attention required

## Contraindications and Precautions

### Absolute Contraindications
- **Pituitary Disorders:** Active pituitary tumors, post-pituitary surgery
- **Active Malignancy:** Current cancer or recent treatment
- **Disrupted HP Axis:** Hypophysectomy, hypopituitarism, head trauma
- **Pediatric Use:** Children with open epiphyses (risk of excessive growth)

### Relative Contraindications
- **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Safety not established
- **Diabetes:** Requires careful glucose monitoring
- **Kidney/Liver Disease:** Use with caution

## Drug Interactions

### Significant Interactions
**Glucocorticoids:**
- **Effect:** Tesamorelin decreases corticosteroid effectiveness

- **Examples:** Prednisone, cortisone

**Diabetes Medications:**
- **Effect:** Potential glucose level changes
- **Monitoring:** Close glucose level surveillance required
- **Examples:** Exenatide, other antidiabetic agents

**Oral Contraceptives:**
