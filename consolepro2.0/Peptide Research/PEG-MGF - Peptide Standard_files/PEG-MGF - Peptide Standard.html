# PEG-MGF Clinical Dosing Guidelines

## Overview
PEG-MGF (Pegylated Mechano Growth Factor) is a modified form of MGF (IGF-1Ec) where polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been attached to extend its half-life from 5-7 minutes to 48-72 hours. It stimulates satellite cell activation, muscle repair, and regeneration following mechanical stress or injury.

## Clinical Research Summary
Based on research studies and clinical applications, PEG-MGF has demonstrated efficacy in:
- Muscle repair and regeneration
- Satellite cell activation and proliferation
- Bone healing and cartilage repair
- Neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement
- Cardiovascular protection
- Anti-inflammatory effects
- Age-related muscle loss prevention
